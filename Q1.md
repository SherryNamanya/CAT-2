# Question 1 
Big O notation describes how an algorithm’s time or space needs grow as the input size increases. It helps compare algorithms by focusing on the dominant factors that affect performance.

Key Points

Abstracting Constants
	•	Ignore constant factors.
	•	Example: 3n is O(n).
	
 Dropping Lower Order Terms
	•	Only the highest-growth term matters.
	•	Example: n² + n is O(n²).
	
 Worst-Case Analysis
	•	Big O shows the worst-case performance.
	•	Example: Linear search is O(n) in the worst case.
	
 Comparing Algorithms
	•	Lower Big O values are more efficient for large inputs.
	•	Example: O(n log n) is better than O(n²) for large data.


 Examples
 
Constant Time – O(1)
  int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {
    return arr[0];
  }

Linear Time – O(n)
  int sumArray(int[] arr) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int x : arr)
        sum += x;
    return sum;
  }


Quadratic Time – O(n²)
  void printPairs(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++)
            System.out.println(arr[i] + " " + arr[j]);
  }
  

Logarithmic Time – O(log n)
  int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
     while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
  }



Data Structures Connection
	
 •	Arrays/Linked Lists:
Traversal is O(n).
	
 •	Hash Tables:
Average operations are O(1).
	
 •	Balanced Trees:
Operations are O(log n).
	
 •	Efficient Sorting:
Sorts like merge sort are O(n log n).
